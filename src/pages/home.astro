        With many years of personal experience in the business and after
        studying Stanislavsky, Uta Hagen, Stella Adler, Sanford Meisner, and
        Viola Spolin’s acting and improvisation methods, it is my honor to share
        my expertise and experience—including all these many methods—with my
        students.
      </p>
      <p class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-light leading-relaxed">
        Using my vast experience and studies, I find what works for each
        individual student—bringing the actor that is lurking within out into
        the open.

      <p>
        The method in which you learn is the method that is taught in class.
        Each individual learns at a different pace and is taught in a way that
        makes the technique clear for them—all in a safe and judgment-free
        environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether it’s scenes, camera work, improvisation, or monologues, we
        collaborate and support each other. A team effort is always stronger
        than an individual’s.
